# Web_Development-Playlist
Playlist made by which you can open Web_Development  videos..
in this playlist I have arranged the first 12 videos of Code with Harry in a table and when you click on the link
it will open a new tab on the website and a embedded video will play. The tough part in making this project for me 
was to open this link on the same website as i did not download the videos but i eventually figured it out
this code is entirelly made my HTML as of now
